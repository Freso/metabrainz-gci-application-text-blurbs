We've had great experiences with previous GCIs, and are hoping to get another great year. :) GCI is a great way for both our own projects and the concepts of open source and open data to get introduced to bright new (and fresh!) minds, as well as (on a very practical level) get a number of smaller "low hanging fruits" picked up.
