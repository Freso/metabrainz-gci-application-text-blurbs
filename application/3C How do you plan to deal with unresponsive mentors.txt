The org. admins will try and keep an eye on tasks that go 12–24 hours without a response from a mentor and prod any attached mentors to look at it to make sure they didn't just miss it. If a mentor doesn't respond via Hangouts or IRC, I will e‐mail them to ask what's up. If they respond, action happening will depend on their response. If there's still no word, I will consider them absent until further notice and take action similar as if they went on holiday (see answer to that question).
