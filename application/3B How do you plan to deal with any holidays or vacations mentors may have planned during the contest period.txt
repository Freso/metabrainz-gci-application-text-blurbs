Hopefully all tasks will have two mentors assigned which should give any one mentor some freedom in availability. We have asked mentors to give word beforehand for any away-time they have planned. If it turns out that there are any tasks where no mentor will be around for a period of time, we will do our best to make sure they get unpublished before the mentor(s) become unavailable (and republished once they come back!).
